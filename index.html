  <p>
    Springtime in <a href="#">Ann Arbor</a> is a beautiful time. Even though it
    can be chilly at times, it is nice to walk my dog Bacon.
    This site includes some pictures I have taken on these walks.
  </p>

  <p>
    Sometimes we walk around the neighborhood, other times we make it
    to the woods. Ann Arbor also has some beautiful lakes and rivers
    including the <a href="#">Huron River Watertrail</a> and the
    <a href="#">Argo Park Cascades</a>.
